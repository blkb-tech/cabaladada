excerpt: "The code for Cabaladadá is now up on GitHub. Go and grab it!"

I've just uploaded the source code for this blog to [GitHub][github], where I
keep the fews lines of code I write and some stuff written in LaTeX. So, if you
were ever wondering how I went about implementing Cabaladadá using Jekyll, go
and have a check!

I'm also working on internationalizing Cabaladadá. Sometimes (like now), I'd
like to write a post in both English and Brazilian Portuguese but I see no need
to create separate pages for each language. The solution I'm working on is
rather simple: I'll just include a link to the translation of a post beneath
its title on the front page and on the post page, before the text begins.

I'm having some trouble figuring out where to put the translations and how to
tell Jekyll not to include them on the main page.

Oh, and there'll soon be a post on Vimperator and Firefox!
