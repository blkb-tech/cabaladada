title: The sky above the port
author: Rafael Beraldo
excerpt: In which I consider a few opening lines from different stories, and decide which one is the best.
---

Every story should start with a memorable line. I can quote Gibson's
_Neuromancer_ first sentence from my head:

> The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.

With this single sentence, Gibson sets the mood of his entire book. The first
obvious element is the port, which is frequently associated with crime, a
suspect place to be, where all kinds of things come from overseas. And
_Neuromancer_ has all to do with crime, suspect places and activities, not to
mention weird objects.

_Color of television_ is a beautifully crafted expression that caries both the
sadness of the gray sky and the mention of technology. Finally, this television
is _tuned to a dead channel_ — I think we can all clearly see this image, and
how the word _dead_ plays a role here.

I have lots of books here. (I’d have many more, but I don’t have room for more
than a few!) I like to browse through them, looking for better opening lines.
Today I opened Graham Greene’s _The Power and the Glory_ by chance, only to read
this amazing sentence:

> Mr Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder, into the blazing Mexican sun
> and the bleaching dust.

I immediately pictured the vast western movie scenarios and _No Country for Old
Men_. I saw particles of dust sweeping through the sky, sweat, mustaches and
bottles of tequila.

But should there be an opening line contest, there’d be already a clear winner.
The best opening line of all is from Douglas Adams’ _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy_:

> Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
> spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.
