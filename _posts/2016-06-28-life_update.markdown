Uneventful, ordinary days should be either feared or celebrated. Every major
change in my life seems to have happened on such days. And this year it was no
different. It must have been a very lazy Sunday afternoon when I got a message
from a friend I hadn't spoken to in a long time. We met because we were both
doing research on computational linguistics back in 2011, under the supervision
of Bento Silva.

I was caught off guard by what she had said: something to the effect that LaTeX
was indeed a great way of producing documents and I'd been right all along. She
had just started writing her PhD thesis, if memory serves my right. Having just
graduated from Unesp, I hadn't used LaTeX in a few months, and I had totally
forgotten about the time I was advocating its use.

A few weeks later we were having coffee and catching up on each other's news.
It was a very stimulating day that rekindled our mutual interested in life and
its possibilities. Through her, I learned that my hometown of S達o Carlos was
teeming with smart computer science people working on amazing projects.

When I got home in Araraquara that night, I went straight to my computer and
searched for like-minded people in S達o Carlos. It didn't take me more than a
couple of minutes to find [OpenSanca](http://opensanca.com.br/), a local free
software and entrepreneurship meetup group. They offer free workshops and talks
about everything technology. I immediately went nuts with excitement. This was
the group I'd been dying to find for years, right there, only 40 minutes away
by car.

I joined their Slack channel right away and introduced myself. I said I was a
linguist with a passion for Linux, technology and programming and mentioned
being a LaTeX user. Right off the bat I was invited to do a workshop on the
subject. I'll talk more about that experience on a later post.

Very soon, I went back to S達o Carlos for a OpenSanca-promoted [AngularJS
workshop](https://speakerdeck.com/opensanca/workshop-de-clean-code-angular-and-mocks)
with Carlos Gomes, who later became a friend. The event was great, jam-packed
with information about clean code, Angular and mocking concepts. I learned a
lot that day and I can't thank Carlos or the OpenSanca staff enough for
putting together such incredible events.

Since then, I've been able to go to a number of talks and workshops. Among so
many other things, I learned what a JavaScript framework really is, how to
program Arduinos and how 3D printing is going to change everything. I'm more
excited than never and the many inspiring people I met over the last three
months made me come to a few realizations and thoughts:

- OpenSanca is a group that promotes technical education free of charge. It is
  exactly what I had been dreaming of since my first education class at
  college. It is living proof that we all have something to teach and something
  to learn, and that empowering our community is not only feasible, but
  incredibly important. I must write a post on this point later this year.
  Also, I'd like to sincerely thank all of OpenSanca's staff, specially
  Cristofer Sousa, who I've had the chance to work with more closely.
- Fuck the Silicon Valley. I'm not trying to be offensive here, but we have to
  face the truth. For a while I dreamed of working and doing great things
  abroad. I still think that would be great, however I realized I was failing
  to look around and see the opportunity that is all around us. We're _not_
  living in the US or Europe. It is very hard to emulate their market and
  infrastructure, so we'll have to make do with what we have at hand instead.
  In other words, innovating has a different meaning in Brazil: it means
  achieving higher grounds in ways that make sense for us. I'll try to develop
  this further in another post, as it's only the germ of an idea.
- Finally, this last idea connects with my most important realization. We are
  seeing the onset of a community that I hope grows to the point of no return,
  forever changing the city of S達o Carlos. May this sense of community that
  free software nurtures spread to other cities all over the country and to
  other areas of our lives too.

When I started this post, my initial intention was to report how my two LaTeX
workshops went and where I failed. It grew to become a rather different beast.
However, it's given me a few ideas to chew on. I'll try to develop the next
three topics in future posts:

1. My two LaTeX workshops: where I failed and where I didn't
2. The importance of informal education groups
3. How doing our own thing may be better than trying to copy Silicon Valley

Stay tuned for more!
