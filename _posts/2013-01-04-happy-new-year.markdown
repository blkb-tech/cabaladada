As 3179 YOLD (or 2013) begins, I felt like writing a happy new year post. Happy
new year!

Blogging-wise, 2012 was a very good year. I [gave Cabaladadá a fresh
start](/2012/harder-better-faster-stronger/) and felt generally happier writing
for it. I managed to write twelve posts — a small number, but writing a lot
wasn't in my plans anyway. I wanted to write at least once a month, and I got
closer than ever.

But I plan to write more. Over the years, as blogs blossomed and were adopted
by all kinds of journalists and specialists, blogging became a very
professional activity. It doesn't have to be tiresome for me, though, and I
don't have to demand from myself posts with content and quality that'll make
people want read Cabaladadá. That simply means my posts should be about
whatever is bugging me at the moment, or whatever I'm doing with my life, the
Universe and everything else. I'd like to write more on cooking and using
GNU/Linux, for example. I often discover programs, fonts, podcasts, books and
many other things that maybe interesting for my fellow hackers and nerds.

This new year will be full of new and exciting challenges. I taught English for
one year and a half, and now I'm looking for a new job. Maybe I'll end up
translating or giving English classes again, but I'll try my best to get a job
related to computers in general, be it deploying GNU/Linux systems, taking care
of servers, teaching or coding in HTML. Although I currently study languages
and literature, I finally accepted that my real passion lies in everything
technology (actually, I find computational linguistics quite interesting), so
it makes sense to start working in a related area.

My girlfriend and I wrote down some new year resolutions. Here are mine:

* Finish college;
* Get a new job;
* Save about 500 reais;
* Be less grumpy;
* Cook more;
* Finish started projects.

That's not too ambitious, but still a number of good accomplishments to brag
about in the future.

Here's hoping I'll be seeing you guys more often! Once more, happy new year!
